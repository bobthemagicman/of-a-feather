            <h4>Find the church for you, find faith activities &amp; events, and get plugged into community.</h4>
            <p>
                We know from experience it&apos;s hard to find the right church. Searching for a church community can feel like an arduous journey full of frustration, fragmented information and resources, especially if you&apos;re new in town.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now finding church for you just got a lot easier. Of a Feather is the Christian&apos;s new best friend for finding a church and local faith-related events that you want to know about. We&apos;ve built an online platform that delivers a personalized church search to help people discover the church that fits them in a faster, easier, and more intuitive way. Some people have called us Yelp for churches. In some ways we&apos;re similar in that we give each church a profile so they can clearly communicate who they are and what they&apos;re about with images, video, ratings, and other helpful information. Our church profiles go deeper to showcase the full picture of a church community. The platform also provides useful search filters to refine your church search based on preferences of styles, languages, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now finding a church community is no longer is a frustrating and daunting task. And churches themselves now have a clear avenue to be found online. Whether you&apos;re new in town, or just want to find extra community activities to join, Of a Feather bridges the gap between people and churches to link the Christian community through technology.

            <h4>Our Story</h4>
            <p>
                A transition from college to career left the founder seeking to a new hole to fill and the search for a new church community began. To her dismay the search for a new church was not easy and proved to be a very frustrating experience, full of fragmented information and lack of good resources. In another part of the country, a similar story of dissatisfaction with the process of finding a church was experienced by her future co-founder. Years later the two founders would cross paths and decide to partner-up with a shared vision that there must be a better way to find a new church and learn about faith-related activities. Of a Feather is the proud product of their dream of making church-finding a frustration-free experience. We do this by making church communities and their activities easily discoverable in a way that&apos;s meaningful for people looking to join or participate.
