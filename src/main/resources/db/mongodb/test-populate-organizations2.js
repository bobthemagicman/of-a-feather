Our Statement of Faith:<br />There is one God, who is infinitely perfect, existing eternally in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br />Jesus Christ is the true God and the true man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died upon the cross, the Just for the unjust, as a substitutionary sacrifice, and all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood. He arose from the dead according to the Scriptures. His now at the right hand of Majesty on high as our great High Priest. He will com again to establish His kingdom, righteousness and peace.<br />The Holy Spirit is a divine person, sent to indwell, guide teach, empower the believer, and convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.<br />The Old and New Testaments, inerrant as originally given, were verbally inspired by God and are a complete revelation of His will for the salvation of men. They constitute the divine and only rule of Christian faith and practice.<br />Man was originally created in the image and likeness of God: he fell through disobedience, incurring thereby both physical and spiritual death. All men are born with a sinful nature, are separated from the life of God, and can be saved only through the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ. The portion of the unrepentant and unbelieving is existence forever in conscious torment; and that of the believer, in everlasting joy and bliss.<br />Salvation has been provided through Jesus Christ for all men; and those who repent and believe in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive the gift of eternal, and become the children of God.<br />It is the will of God that each believer should be filled with the Holy Spirit and be sanctified wholly, being separated from sin and the world and fully dedicated to the will of God, thereby receiving power for holy living and effective service. This is both a crisis and a progressive experience wrought in the life of the believer subsequent to conversion.<br />Provision is made in the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ for the healing of the mortal body. Prayer for the sick and anointing with oil are taught in the Scriptures and are privileges for the Church in this present age.<br />The Church consists of all those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, are redeemed through His blood, and are born again of the Holy Spirit. Christ is the head of the Body, the Church, which has been commissioned by Him to go into all the world as a witness, preaching the gospel to all nations. The local church is a body of believers in Christ who are joined together for the worship of God, for edification through the Word of God, for prayer, fellowship, the proclamation of the gospel, and observance of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper.<br />There shall be a bodily resurrection of the just and of the unjust; for the former, a resurrection unto life; for the latter, a resurrection unto judgment.<br />The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is imminent and will be personal, visible and premillennial. This is the believer&#39;s blessed hope and is a vital truth which is an incentive to holy living and faithful service.",

Ask questions. Know what you believe. We have briefly outlined below several key beliefs that are essential to an active Christian life. top<br /><br />1. We believe the Bible is God&#39;s Word given by divine inspiration, the record of God&#39;s revelation of Himself to humanity (II Timothy 3:16). top<br /><br />2. We believe in the one living and true God, perfect in wisdom, sovereignty, holiness, justice, mercy and love (I Timothy 1:17; Psalm 86:15; Deuteronomy 32:3-4). top<br /><br />3. We believe God created an order of spiritual beings called angels to serve Him and do His will (Psalm 148:1-5; Colossians 1:16). top<br /><br />4. We believe God created man in His own image to have fellowship with Himself and to be steward over His creation (Genesis 1:26-28). top<br /><br />5. We believe salvation is redemption by Christ of the whole person from sin and death (II Timothy 1:9-10; I Thessalonians 5:23). top<br /><br />6. We believe the Church is the body of which Christ is the head and all who believe in Him are members (Ephesians 1:22-23; Romans 12:4-5). top<br /><br />7. We believe religious liberty, rooted in Scripture, is the inalienable right of all individuals to freedom of conscience with ultimate accountability to God (Genesis 1:27; John 8:32; II Corinthians 3:17; Romans 8:21; Acts 5:29). top<br /><br />8. We believe Christians, individually and collectively, are salt and light in society (Matthew 5:13-16). top<br /><br />9. We believe God, in His own time and in His own way, will bring all things to their appropriate end and establish the new heaven and the new earth (Ephesians 1:9-10, Revelation 21:1). top",

    "statementOfFaith": "STATEMENT OF FAITH<br /><br />The whole Bible is our sufficient rule for faith and practice. This Statement of Faith is intended as a basis of fellowship among us (i.e. that we all speak the same things, I Corinthians 1 - 10; Acts 2:42). <br /><br />1. The Scriptures Inspired - We believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, a revelation from God to man, the infallible rule of faith and con duct, and is superior to conscience but not contrary to reason (II Timothy 3:15, 16; I Peter 2:2).<br /><br />2. The One True God - We believe that the One True God has revealed Himself in three persons, as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. He is the eternally self-existing, self-revealed &quot;I AM;&quot; and has further revealed Himself as embodying the principles of Mark 12:29; Isaiah 43:10, 11; Matthew 28:19 and Luke 3:22.<br /><br />3. Man, His Fall & Redemption - We believe man was created good and upright; for God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.&quot; But, man, by voluntary transgression, fell and his only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God by the virtue of his shed blood on the cross. (Genesis 1:26 - 31; 3:1 - 7; Romans 5:12-21).<br /><br />4. The Salvation of Man - We believe that salvation comes through the Lord Jesus Christ, who was born of a virgin, willingly gave His life for us and rose again on the third day. Man is saved by the washing and the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and being justified by grace through faith, he becomes an heir of God according to the hope of eternal life (Titus 2:11; Romans 10:12 - 15; Luke 23:47; Titus 3:5 - 7).<br /><br />5. Baptism In Water - Water Baptism is an immersion in water representing an identification with the death, burial and resurrec_tion of Christ, having so done they have taken on the family name and hereby declare to the world that they have died with Jesus and that they have also been raise with Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Acts 10:47, 48; Romans 6:4; Acts 20:21; Hebrews 10:2 2). Infants and small children may be dedicated to the Lord whenever requested (Mark 10:16; Luke 18:15 -16).<br /><br />6. The Lord&#39;s Supper - The sacrament of the Lord&#39;s Supper is observed by partaking of bread and the fruit of the vine to represent, by faith, the virtue that was in the body and blood of the Lord. This is an act of sharing, one member with another, which brings a cleansing and unifying of the Body of Christ (I Corinthians 11:26).<br /><br />7. Promise of the Father - All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly ask the promise of the Father - the Baptism in the Holy Spirit and the Fire, according to the command of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian Church. With it comes Power for life and service, the bestowal of the gifts and their use in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4, 8; I Corinthians 12:1 - 21). This wonderful experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of the new birth (Acts 10:44-46, 11:14-16, 15:7-9). The Baptism of believers in the Holy Ghost is evidenced by the initial physical sign of speaking with other tongues as the Spirit of God gives them utterance (Acts 2:4).<br /><br />8. Entire Sanctification - The Scriptures teach a life of holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. By the power of the Holy Ghost we are able to obey the command, &quot;Be ye holy, for I am holy.&quot; Entire sanctification is the will of God for all Believers (I Peter 1:15, 16; I Thessalonians 5:23; I John 2:6).<br /><br />9. The Church - The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine appoint ments for the fulfillment of her great commission. Each believer, born of the Spirit, is an integral part of the Church of the Firstborn, which are written in Heaven (Ephesians 1:22, 23; Hebrews 12:23). Jesus is held in the heavens until the full restoration of a glorious church.<br /><br />10. The Ministry & Evangelism - A divinely called and Scripturally-ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for a two-fold pur pose: The evangelization of the world and the edifying of the Body of Christ (Mark 16:15-20; Ephesians 4:13).<br /><br />11. Divine Healing - Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the atonement, and is the privilege of all Believers (Isaiah 54:4, 5; Matthew 8:16, 17).<br /><br />12. Laying On of Hands - God is ever unfolding truth such as the Laying On of Hands for gifts and ministries (I Timothy 4:14; Ephesians 4:11; I Corinthians 12).<br /><br />13. The Blessed Hope - The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the Church (I Thessalonians 4:16, 17; Romans 8:23; Titus 2:13; I Corinthians 15:51, 52).<br /><br /> 14. The Lake of Fire - The Devil and his angels, the Beast and the False Prophet, and whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life shall be consigned to everlasting punish ment in the lake which burneth with fire and brimsto ne, which is the second death (Revelation 19:20; 20:10-15).<br /><br />15. The New Heavens & The New Earth - We &quot;according to His promise look for the new heaven and new earth wherein dwells righteousness.&quot; (II Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:25).<br /><br />16. The God ordained sacrament of marriage in the Bible is defined as a legal union between one man and one woman for a lifetime, (Genesis 2:22-25 NKJV).",

We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of God and inerrant in the original writings.<br />2. We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons, Father, Son, & Holy Spirit<br />3. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, that He died in our place and through His shed blood we receive the forgiveness of sins, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory.<br />4. We believe that lost and sinful man must be saved from this condition, and that man&#39;s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br />5. We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live the Christian life.<br />6. We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the unsaved; they that are saved unto a resurrection of life and they that are unsaved unto a resurrection of damnation.<br />7. We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in our Lord Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Statement of Distinctives we hold to:<br />¥ The inerrancy of Scripture<br />¥ The present day continuation of the spiritual gifts that Paul wrote of in 1 Corinthians 12-14<br />¥ Simplicity in church government, rather than a complex bureaucracy<br />¥ A dependence upon the Holy Spirit to lead, rather than ambitious promotion of someone&#39;s agenda<br />¥ The premillennial, pre-tribulation return of Christ for His waiting church<br />¥ The verse by verse teaching of the Word of God in such a way that it leads toward spiritual maturity<br /><br />You Will NOT Find at Calvary Chapel<br />¥ The teaching of Ôpositive confession&#39;<br />¥ The belief that true Christians can be possessed by demons<br />¥ A fatalistic Calvinistic view which allows no room for free will<br />¥ Prophecy that supersedes Scripture<br />¥ The incorporation of humanistic psychology and philosophy into Biblical teaching<br />¥ &quot;Charismania&quot; (the over emphasis upon spiritual gifts, experiential signs and wonders, etc.)",

Born and raised in Concord, David grew up in what was a very functional home. He fought with his brother and two sisters, argued with his parents, and often struggled in school. Life was good. Life was &quot;normal.&quot; Then in 1972, when David was 10, life changed. David&#39;s family had never gone to church much, but someone invited them one Sunday and they heard a message that would change their lives forever.  David that heard that Jesus died and rose for him and that he could be forgiven for all of his wrong and become part of God&#39;s family simply by accepting what Jesus had done. David became a follower of Christ and life took an exciting turn. David prayed about what God would have him do with his life.  Since he was very young, David had always dreamed of being a lawyer, but by his junior year of high school, he knew God wanted him to pastor. David went on to college to earn a BA in Bible and a BA in Speech. Grad school led him to an MA in Biblical Studies and an MDiv. While in graduate school, David met his wife at a church in Martinez, where he was an Associate Pastor.  About four months after Cindy and David became engaged, Hillside Baptist Church (Hillside Church) contacted David and asked if he would consider coming as their pastor.  The church had declined and was deeply concerned for their welfare.  David came in September of 1989 and Cindy and David were married in October of 1989.  David continues as lead pastor.  David and Cindy now have three amazing daughters.  David enjoys running, kick boxing, water sports, snow skiing, and travelling.  Most of all, he loves sharing the greatest message of all with people.",

Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven&#39;s glory and will return again someday to earth to reign as King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.<br /> Matthew 1:22,23; Isaiah 9:6; John 1:1-5, 14:10-30; Hebrews 4:14,15; I Corinthians 15:3, 4; Romans 1:3, 4; Acts 1:9-11; I Timothy 6:14,15; Titus 2:13<br /><br /> 3. ABOUT THE HOLY SPIRIT.<br /> The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians we seek to live under His control daily.<br /> II Corinthians 3:17; John 16:7-13, 14:16,17; Acts 1:8;<br /> I Corinthians 2:12, 3:16; Ephesians 1:13; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 5:18<br /><br />4. ABOUT THE BIBLE.<br />The Bible is God&#39;s Word to us. It was written by human authors, under the supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is the truth without any mixture of error.<br /> II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:20,21; II Timothy 1:13;<br /> Psalm 119:105, 160; 12:6; Proverbs 30:5<br /><br />5. ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS.<br /> People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. People are the supreme object of God&#39;s creation. Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called &quot;sin.&quot; This attitude separates people from God and causes many problems in life.<br />Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a; Romans 3:23;<br />Isaiah 59:1, 2<br /><br />6. ABOUT SALVATION.<br />Salvation is God&#39;s free gift to us but we must accept it. We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God&#39;s offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin&#39;s penalty. When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith.<br />Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9; John 14:6, 1:12; Titus 3:5; Galatians 3:26; Romans 5:1<br /><br />7. ABOUT ETERNAL SECURITY.<br />Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the true believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. If you have been genuinely saved, you cannot &quot;lose&quot; it. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives us this security.<br />John 10:29; II Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25, 10:10,14; <br />I Peter 1:3-5<br /><br />8. ABOUT ETERNITY.<br />People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or eternally with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are real places of eternal existence.<br />John 3:16, 2:25, 5:11-13; Romans 6:23; Revelation 20:15; Matthew 1:8, 2:44, 46",

Our passion is to create an atmosphere of family as we build Christian community with our friends at Kingsway.

    "missionStatement": "We are committed to... <br /><br />¥ Living in the Spirit<br />We believe that the life of God comes to us through the Holy Spirit. <br />We want to experience God&#39;s manifest presence as we worship and <br />pray in the Holy Spirit. We see the Holy Spirit&#39;s ministry and gifts in the life of the believer and the church as a key to holiness, fruitfulness and effective mission, as every member is thoroughly filled with the Spirit, walks in step with the Spirit, and flows in the anointing and ministry of the Spirit.<br /><br />¥ Building the church<br />We believe that God plans to change the world through His church, <br />the Body of Christ. We therefore want to see relationship at the heart of how we are called to build together: celebration of believers&#39; baptisms and breaking of bread at the center of our fellowship, the release of every-member ministry and Ephesians 4 ministries as keys to God&#39;s mission, and church-planting as a call of God in expanding His kingdom.<br /><br />¥ Seeking the Kingdom<br />Christ&#39;s primary call on our lives is to be a people who are centered <br />on Him and seeking His Kingdom. We therefore are determined to <br />seek God&#39;s Kingdom 24/7, in our families, at work, in leisure, and in the family of the church. We want to keep being transformed to be like the King. We want to preach, live and demonstrate the gospel of the Kingdom, attending to issues of injustice, poverty and bondage in society.<br /><br />¥ Focusing on mission<br />We believe that God is on a mission to demonstrate his love to His <br />world, to redeem the world from its sin, and to gather a huge family to himself from across the nations. As God&#39;s people, we must be on the same mission. Therefore we want to be proclaiming the Good News; demonstrating the Good News in every aspect of culture and society; seeing lives transformed by the power of Jesus; living the Good News.<br /><br />We are characterized by...  <br /><br />¥ Relationship<br />Everything in the Body of Christ is relational! We believe brother/sister relationships, pastor/disciple relationships and small group relationships are key to the life of the church family.<br /> <br />¥ Family<br />God works through spiritual and natural family to give us a place <br />of belonging, love, joy, security, friendship, vision, and care. Fatherhood and motherhood are key to strong, healthy families! There is a joint mandate for men and women to rule together within families. We also recognize the spiritual headship of men within family. Our churches appoint men to be elders, but are also clear that women have an important place of leadership in our church families, just as in our natural families. <br /><br />¥ Leadership <br />Anointed servant leadership, as Jesus taught it and modelled it, is vital to build up everyone in the body of Christ, and help all to grow to full maturity and fulfil their God-given destiny. We recognize the <br />importance of spiritual fatherhood. This is a vital aspect of apostolic ministry and is a key to building family. The model for all leadership is Jesus himself!<br /><br />¥ Generosity<br />Generous living and giving is a key to individuals and communities enjoying the blessing of God. Tithing is a starting point for giving, but generosity will take us far beyond that. We encourage the practice of tithing to the local church of which we are part, where we are cared for spiritually. We see tithes as sustaining the ministry of church and mission, and offerings for good works, buildings etc.<br /><br />¥ Discipleship<br />Discipleship is a key to growing all of God&#39;s people into maturity, so that each one can play their full part in the purposes of God&#39;s Kingdom. We encourage strongly the fostering of relationships of discipleship, where personal pastoring and mentoring are key. In our view, this is essential.<br /><br />¥ Ephesians 4 ministry<br />We believe that receiving apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers into local churches brings increased vision and spiritual impact, and provides good care, counsel and accountability for local church leaders.<br /><br />¥ Wider relationships<br />We encourage an atmosphere of working together with other churches. We believe that it is one mark of healthy churches to relate to and receive from others. This enables the wider Body of <br />Christ to be built up, and allows Christ&#39;s mission to be more fruitful.<br /><br />¥ Diversity<br />We value the diversity of leadership and different models of church. We believe this helps us to understand and enjoy the richness of the body of Christ, and we want to live in an atmosphere of respect and mutual appreciation. This diversity is a positive, edifying feature of the Body of Christ!",

    "statementOfFaith": "Section 1: The Word of God<br /><br />We believe that the Bible is the fully inspired Word of God, both the Old and New Testaments, and without error in the original manuscripts, written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and that it has supreme authority in all matters of faith and conduct (John 17:17; Romans 15:4; II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:19-21).<br /><br />Section 2: The Trinity<br /><br />We believe there is one living and true God, eternally existing in three persons Ð God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit; that they are equal in every divine perfection; and that they execute distinct, but harmonious offices in the work of creation, providence, and redemption (Matthew 28:19; John 1:1-4; II Corinthians 13:14; Hebrews 9:14; Genesis 1:26).<br /><br />Section 3: God the Father<br /><br />We believe in God, the Father, an infinite personal spirit, perfect in holiness, wisdom, power and love. We believe that He concerns Himself mercifully in the affairs of men, that He hears and answers prayer, that He saves from sin and spiritual death all who come to Him through Jesus Christ (John 3:16-17; John 4:24; John 17:5).<br /><br />Section 4: Jesus Christ<br /><br />We believe in Jesus Christ, God&#39;s only begotten Son, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit. We believe in His virgin birth, sinless life, miracles and teachings. We believe in His substitutionary atoning death, bodily resurrection, ascension into heaven, perpetual intercession for His people, future return for His Church, and personal visible return to earth as King of Kings and Lord of Lords (Isaiah 7:14; John 1:14; Philippians 2:5-11; Hebrews 1:2-3; I John 1:7; I Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 19:11-16).<br /><br />Section 5: The Holy Spirit<br /><br />We believe in the Holy Spirit who came forth from the Father and Son to convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment; and to regenerate, sanctify, and empower all who believe in Jesus Christ. We believe that the Holy Spirit indwells every believer in Christ, and that He is an abiding helper, teacher, and guide (John 14:26; 16:7-15; Romans 8:14-17; Ephesians 1:13-14).<br /><br />Section 6: Salvation<br /><br />We believe that all men are sinners by nature and by choice and are, therefore, under condemnation. We believe that those who repent of their sins and trust in Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord are saved from the penalty of sin, born again unto eternal life by the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, and brought into personal fellowship with God. We believe that this salvation is a free gift from God, effected upon the ground of the shed blood of Jesus Christ alone, that it is given by grace and received by faith, and that apart from Jesus Christ salvation is impossible (John 1:12-13; 3:3, 16-17; Acts 4:12; 20:21; Ephesians 2:1-9; Titus 3:5).<br /><br />Section 7: The Church<br /><br />We believe in the universal church, a living spiritual body of which Christ is the Head and all regenerated persons are members. We believe in the local church, consisting of a company of believers in Jesus Christ, who have been baptized by immersion subsequent to profession of their faith in Christ, and who are associated for worship, work, and fellowship. We believe that God has laid upon the members of the local church the primary task of giving the gospel of Jesus Christ to a lost world (Matthew 16:16-18; Acts 2:38-41; Ephesians 2:19-22; 5:25-27; Matthew 28:18-20).<br /><br />Section 8: Christian Conduct<br /><br />We believe that a Christian should live for the glory of God and the well-being of his fellow men, that his conduct should be blameless before the world, that he should be a faithful steward of his possessions, and that he should seek to realize for himself and others the full stature of maturity in Christ (Matthew 5:16; II Corinthians 9:6-8; Ephesians 4:11-16; Philippians 2:14-16; Colossians 3:17-23;<br />I Thessalonians 5:17-18).<br /><br />Section 9: The Ordinances<br /><br />We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has committed two ordinances to the local church, baptism and the Lord&#39;s Supper. We believe that Christian baptism is the immersion of a believer in water into the Name of the triune God. We believe that the Lord&#39;s Supper was instituted by Christ for commemoration of His death. We believe that the two ordinances should be observed and administered until the return of the Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 2:41; 8:38-39; I Corinthians 11:23-32).<br /><br />Section 10: Religious Liberty<br /><br />We believe that every human being has direct relations with God, and is responsible to God alone in all matters of faith; that each church is independent and must be free from interference by an ecclesiastical or political authority; that, therefore, Church and State must be kept separate as having different functions, each fulfilling its duties free from dictation or patronage of the other (Matthew 22:21; Acts 4:18-19, 29; Romans 13:7; I Peter 2:9).<br /><br />Section 11: The Last Things<br /><br />We believe in the personal and visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth and the establishment of His kingdom. We believe in the resurrection of the body, the final judgment, the eternal blessedness of the saved, and the endless suffering of the lost (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:28-29;<br />II Corinthians 5:10; Revelation 20:1-15).<br /><br />Section 12: Theological Perspective<br /><br />The teaching and practice of Trinity Bible Church shall be that which is consistent with our belief in 1) the premillennial return of Christ, 2) the pretribulational rapture of the church, and 3) the &quot;non-charismatic&quot; understanding of the existence and practice of spiritual gifts, (Zechariah 14; Revelation 20:1-6; I Thessalonians 4:16-18; Revelation 3:10; I Corinthians 13:8-12; I Peter 4:10,11).",

    "statementOfFaith": "Statement of Faith<br />We believe in one God who alone is to be worshipped, who rules the universe and created everything. He has revealed Himself as Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br /><br />We believe in the Father: Holy, Almighty and loving, the source of all goodness, truth and life.<br /><br />We believe in the Son, one with the Father, our Lord Jesus Christ who was sent into the world by the Father&#39;s love, conceived by the Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He was crucified for our sins and raised from the dead by the power of God. He now sits at the Father&#39;s right hand praying and advocating for His Church and will return to judge everyone on earth. Then every knee will bow before Him in honor and every person will agree that Jesus always has been, is now, and always will be Lord.<br /><br />We believe in the Holy Spirit, one with the Father and Son, who inspired the Scriptures, who by His grace brings to new spiritual birth all who believe in Jesus through repentance, who lives in them as a guarantee of eternal life, empowers them for holy living and loving relationships, and distributes to them gifts of power for service and ministry.<br /><br />We believe that human beings were created in God&#39;s image, but were alienated from God because of sin and now live in a sin-damaged world. We, therefore, are unable to restore the broken relationship ourselves. God, in His love and mercy, through Jesus&#39; sacrifice on the cross, restores those who believe and repent, giving them a new birth, new identity, and new nature.<br /><br />We believe God brings all His new-born children into His family, the Church. This eternal body is revealed in the local church wherever His people gather for worship, relationship, teaching, and service around His Word. As Lord of His Church, Jesus directs us to tell everyone everywhere about Him so that they too might follow Him and be saved from eternal judgment. One day He will come and gather all His Church to be with Him in heaven&#39;s glory forever.<br /><br />We believe that the Church is the body of Jesus on earth and God&#39;s family. Through these family relationships, God utilizes His Spirit to promote unity, to cause healing, to exercise His gifts, and to mobilize a great army of Christ-followers who join with Him in the fight against the evil, demonic powers of darkness at work both in our world here and in the heavenly places.<br /><br />We believe in the Bible as God&#39;s inspired, timeless and relevant Word to all people. In it He reveals the truth which we believe and commit to follow. It is completely trustworthy and our authoritative guide for conduct as individuals, as families and as a Church.",

The owners were professional Latin Jazz Artists and asked if I would bring a few guys from our Church to have a little coffee, some live music and a Bible Study.  People liked it so much, hearing the Jazz, Gospel and Blues they thought it was a night club. It became a church after one year. I had been in the ministry in San Jose, Ca. for over 20 years at the same church.  We knew right away God was taking us to a new place with a new approach that was outside of the box. We changed our dress code to everyday clothes; Jeans, Levi&#39;s and comfortable clothes, so that the people in the City would not feel they had to wear a suit, which in the Mission District most people did not have.  The Java Shop was located in the Mission District on 24th. and Potrero Ave. We named it &#39;THE MISSION 24&#39; and our focus turned to people from the streets, those that were on drugs and homeless.  Our motto is &#39;Come to Jesus not Religion&#39; Come as you are! Matthew 11:28.  I have four children ages from 11, 12, 14 and 25 been married for 26 years to my wife Rebecca. Since the beginning our Gospel Blues Band has played through out California at Bike and Car shows, Rely for Life Cancer Walk and for 6 Time World Boxing Champion Robert the Ghost Guerrero home coming in Gilroy, Ca. We also are very connected to CROSS Ministries: a motorcycle club based in Gilroy, Ca. We ride to events and outreaches in several communities across the bay area.  We use the Motorcycles as a tool to meet people on the streets and bring Jesus to them.",
