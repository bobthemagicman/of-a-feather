We have three children, and found Lakeside Temple when we went church shopping many years ago.  The peace was compelling, and the teachings were enlightening.<br /><br />I worked for Chevron for 16 years, leaving when our youngest child was a year old.  I took all the Temple classes just because I wanted to learn to live more effectively.  Eventually I was ordained (in 2000) and became Minister in 2001.  I love my job, and I enjoy our weekly singing workshop, led by our choral director and voice coach, Dieter Erbelding.",

Born and raised in Concord, David grew up in what was a very functional home. He fought with his brother and two sisters, argued with his parents, and often struggled in school. Life was good. Life was &quot;normal.&quot; Then in 1972, when David was 10, life changed. David&#39;s family had never gone to church much, but someone invited them one Sunday and they heard a message that would change their lives forever.  David that heard that Jesus died and rose for him and that he could be forgiven for all of his wrong and become part of GodÕs family simply by accepting what Jesus had done. David became a follower of Christ and life took an exciting turn. David prayed about what God would have him do with his life.  Since he was very young, David had always dreamed of being a lawyer, but by his junior year of high school, he knew God wanted him to pastor. David went on to college to earn a BA in Bible and a BA in Speech. Grad school led him to an MA in Biblical Studies and an MDiv. While in graduate school, David met his wife at a church in Martinez, where he was an Associate Pastor.  About four months after Cindy and David became engaged, Hillside Baptist Church (Hillside Church) contacted David and asked if he would consider coming as their pastor.  The church had declined and was deeply concerned for their welfare.  David came in September of 1989 and Cindy and David were married in October of 1989.  David continues as lead pastor.  David and Cindy now have three amazing daughters.  David enjoys running, kick boxing, water sports, snow skiing, and travelling.  Most of all, he loves sharing the greatest message of all with people.",

In 2007 the lord told me, &quot;bryan tell my people I love them, tell my people I died for them, my message is still love&quot; - this is the core of my personal mission and ministry. Was ordained of Abundant Life New generation ministries in Oakland in 2004. The lord gave him the name of the church, <br />rededicated life to the lord in 2001, lord began to piece together everything for the start of this church. One of the pieces was the name of the church &quot;latter rain&quot;, &quot;the sun shines of the beautiful latter rain that commeth against my window payne&quot;. <br /><br />married in 2005. <br /><br />pieces that began to fall in place like a thread. He began to reveal his heart and show me what he wanted me to do. <br />I&#39;m working on a worship cd in the key of rhema, play the acoustic guitar and piano and all the arrangements god gave to me. <br /><br />started this church in his living room. I feel this is the birthing time, I know god is bringing in the harvest. <br /><br />used to work at summet medical center in environmental services, god tole him to leave his job in 2005 and sent him 2000 miles to minister to one soul. I wasn&#39;t even married. all my earthly possessions were in my car and trusted the lord. When I left my job, my wife manifested. I never knew my grandfather all I had was his name. I knew the lord had told me to go to little rock Arkansas. on the way I met my grandfather for the very first time and many of his relatives. left after a few days to little rock Arkansas, walked through double doors of this hotel was immediately refreshed, was lord allowed me to lay hands on this lady had brain tumor, and the lord healed her and the holy spirit revealed it to him that he healed her I felt the lord touch that lady. He wanted to show me how much he loved his people and the importance about what real ministry is about.

The owners were professional Latin Jazz Artists and asked if I would bring a few guys from our Church to have a little coffee, some live music and a Bible Study.  People liked it so much, hearing the Jazz, Gospel and Blues they thought it was a night club. It became a church after one year. I had been in the ministry in San Jose, Ca. for over 20 years at the same church.  We knew right away God was taking us to a new place with a new approach that was outside of the box. We changed our dress code to everyday clothes; Jeans, Levi&#39;s and comfortable clothes, so that the people in the City would not feel they had to wear a suit, which in the Mission District most people did not have.  The Java Shop was located in the Mission District on 24th. and Potrero Ave. We named it &#39;THE MISSION 24&#39; and our focus turned to people from the streets, those that were on drugs and homeless.  Our motto is &#39;Come to Jesus not Religion&#39; Come as you are! Matthew 11:28.  I have four children ages from 11, 12, 14 and 25 been married for 26 years to my wife Rebecca. Since the beginning our Gospel Blues Band has played through out California at Bike and Car shows, Rely for Life Cancer Walk and for 6 Time World Boxing Champion Robert the Ghost Guerrero home coming in Gilroy, Ca. We also are very connected to CROSS Ministries: a motorcycle club based in Gilroy, Ca. We ride to events and outreaches in several communities across the bay area.  We use the Motorcycles as a tool to meet people on the streets and bring Jesus to them.",

Pastor Tim is passionate about the sense of community at Halcyon which is reflected in our simple purpose statement which is:<br /><br />&quot;Halcyon Baptist Church exists to raise up disciples who:<br /><br />Love God<br />Love One Another<br />Love All People&quot;<br />Family is huge for Pastor Tim as is demonstrated by his deep love for his wife of 30 years, Janet Lee and their four children. This is also demonstrated by his commitment to his church family. His door and his heart are open to all who need him, and he strives to see that his values for spiritual family and community are the heart and soul of Halcyon Baptist Church.<br /><br />His life verse is (ask him about it sometime):<br />Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)<br />&quot;I know the plans I have for you,&#39; declares the Lord, &#39;Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you a hope and a future.&quot;",
